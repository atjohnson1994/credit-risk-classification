# Overview
- This analysis measures the accuracy of a supervised machine learning model in determining if a loan will be high-risk or not.

# Report
- Accuracy: 0.99
- Recall: 0.95
- Precision: 0.92

# Summary
- The machine learning model that was applied was very effective at predicting healthy loans. The model only missed 56 high-risk loans out of 19384 total loans.
  However, the model predicts more loans as being high-risk then there actually were.
  Although, it could be argued that it's better to deny more loan applicants than it is to disperse more high-risk loans.
